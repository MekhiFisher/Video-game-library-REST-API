# Video-game-library-REST-API
This is my video game library where you can add video games you own to the library. You can add the publisher, time played, genres, notes, etc. You can also get your video games by the id. You can also get all of the games through a certain publisher. You can also do that with genres as well. If you put the wrong publisher you can change the publisher. If you feel like a genre doesn't quite fit the game anymore you can change the publisher. You can make updates the time played and any notes you have taken whiile playing. You can also delete video games and publishers. But be carefull deleting the publishers. If you delete a publisher then all of the games that were made by that publisher will also get deleted as well.
